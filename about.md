## Mission

Good Company Victoria (GCV) is an independent not-for-profit society for advocating for people who work in the tech industry in Greater Victoria.
Our core values are:

- People-centricity: focus on empowering individual workers by connecting, networking, and information sharing.
- Independence: remaining independent of business interests and corporate influence as a community advocating the individual workers and their rights.
- Transparency: advocating for more transparency and equal and free access to information, and exemplifying transparency as an organization.


## Pillars

Good Company Victoria believes that there are good companies in Victoria and built on common pillars which makes them great. GCV’s goal is to promote the following pillars to see more healthy and successful companies in Victoria with developing and engaged employees.

- Honesty and Forthcoming: Information is shared as openly as possible and the sharing of information is encouraged, especially when it is not easy.
- Safety and Equity: Workers are treated with respect and are never mistreated or taken advantage of. Workers are safe from sexism, sexual harassment, racism, and homophobia.
- Inclusion and Diversity: Diversity of experience and background lead to stronger teams and better collaboration. Companies are successful when they intentionally build inclusive environments. 
- Worker Advocacy: A good company supports workers beyond the immediacy of the current situation. A good company provides opportunities for the workers to grow personally and technically. A good company will fight for the employee both in the office and in the community. Companies take a proactive stance towards ensuring worker’s physical and mental health and work-life balance.
